# Customer Segmentation for Online Retail Store
## Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation for a UK-based online retail store. The primary objective is to divide the customer base into distinct clusters based on purchasing behaviors. These insights can then be used for targeted marketing strategies.

## Business Problem
The online retail store had a broad customer base but lacked a targeted marketing strategy. Segmenting the customer base allows for more effective allocation of marketing resources, tailored customer engagement, and potentially higher revenues.

## Data
The dataset includes transactional data from December 2010 to December 2011 and consists of the following fields:

Invoice No
Stock Code
Description
Quantity
Invoice Date
Unit Price
Customer ID
Country
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas for data manipulation
Scikit-learn for machine learning
Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization

## Methodology
The project involves several steps:

Data Cleaning: Missing values and outliers were dealt with.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovered key patterns and exceptional cases.
Feature Engineering: Created summarized metrics like total spending per customer.
Clustering Algorithms: Used Agglomerative Clustering for customer segmentation.
Analysis and Business Insights: Derived actionable insights from the clusters.

## Results
The customer base was successfully segmented into different clusters, each showing distinct purchasing behaviors. For example, one cluster represented high-spenders while another indicated customers who bought in bulk but spent less.

## Conclusion and Future Work
The customer segmentation was successfully implemented, revealing distinct customer behaviors that can be leveraged for targeted marketing. Future work could involve re-running the model periodically to adapt to changing customer behaviors and testing the effectiveness of targeted marketing strategies.
